Warehouse Management System

The project aims to develop a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to efficiently handle a large facility with multiple sections, including both positive and negative temperature zones. The system will focus on inventory management and control, tracking of stock levels, and monitoring of inbound and outbound goods. Additionally, it will incorporate advanced features for temperature regulation and control across refrigerated units and all other areas within the warehouse.
